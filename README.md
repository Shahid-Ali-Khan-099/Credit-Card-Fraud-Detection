# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
• Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

• Conducted extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, scale numerical features, and address class imbalance.

• Employed feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information and enhance the predictive power of the model.

• I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and Decision Trees, to identify the most effective approach for 
   fraud detection.

• Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy ensuring robustness and effectiveness in detecting fraudulent activities.
